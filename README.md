# Telegram Bots for ML models

Artificial Intelligence has made huge strides in recent years, allowing us to train and use machine learning models for various applications. One platform that has been widely used for communication and messaging is Telegram. Here, we will explore how to develop Telegram bots using Python and implement machine learning models in them.

To develop Telegram bots, we will be using the telebot library. This library provides a simple way to interact with the Telegram Bot API, allowing us to build bots with ease.
