# Telegram Bot for Kitchenware Classification Model

This project starts with the model that was trained for the competition organized in Kaggle by [DataTalks.Club](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification/overview).

You can see the development of my solution [here](https://github.com/mary435/kitchenware_classification.git).

Now we are going to implement another solution through a telegram bot, we will be using the telebot library. This library offers a convenient way to communicate with the Telegram Bot API, enabling us to construct bots with ease.

Once our Telegram bot is functioning as desired, we can deploy it on AWS Lambda, a serverless computing platform, so it can run in the cloud.


The first step is to install the library using pip
```
pip install telebot
```

Once we have installed the library, we can start building our bot. We will start by setting up a basic bot that can respond to messages. We can use the following code to do this:

```
