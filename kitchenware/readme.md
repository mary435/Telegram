# Telegram Bot for Kitchenware Classification Model

This project starts with the model that was trained for the competition organized in Kaggle by [DataTalks.Club](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification/overview).

You can see the development of my solution [here](https://github.com/mary435/kitchenware_classification.git). 

And this is the invitation link to the telegram app to test the model: [Telegram Kitchenware Classification](https://t.me/MaryPython_bot)

But if you want to develop your own bot, I'll explain the steps I followed in mine.

First consider that we already have a config.py file with the API Token of your telegram bot. If not, you can follow the steps [here](../README.md).

Now we install the necessary libraries in the environment that you prefer conda or pipenv, from request.txt.

```
pip install request.txt
```

```

```
